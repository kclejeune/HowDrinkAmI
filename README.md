# How Drink am I?

## What You Need to Know
Created for hackCWRU 2018 - 
We aim to provide a convenient solution to prevent binge drinking.  Using a simple linear regression model, we can correlate the delay from a base reaction time with blood alcohol levels. The first time the user opens the app, they will be asked to complete a simple test that takes no longer than 30 seconds in order to establish a base reaction time. Once this has been initiated, the next time the user accesses the app and has been drinking, they can take the test to see what their blood alcohol level is. The goal of the app is to allow users to see when they have had too much to drink, or when it is ok to have more.

# How Drink am I?
a project for HackCWRU 2018
## What You Need to Know
We provide a simplistic, research driven solution to prevent binge drinking.  Using a linear regression model, we can correlate an individual's "choice reaction time," or CRT, (a choice which requires both physical and cognitive processing) with their blood alcohol concentration. Upon first use, users will be asked to complete a simple test that takes no longer than 30 seconds to establish a base reaction time. Once this data is collected, the app can properly function. When a user begins drinking, they will perform the same test from before, using the change from a baseline as an independent variable. We aim to help users drink safely, hopefully reducing the ever growing issue of alcohol abuse among collegiate youth.
